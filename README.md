## 🔧 Setting Up the Project

Follow these steps in order for a successful setup:

---

### 1️⃣ Clone the Project

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jaafarhawli/Tech-Collab.git
cd Tech-Collab
```

---

### 2️⃣ Setup the Backend (Laravel)

```bash
cd backend
composer install
cp .env.example .env
```

Update the `.env` file as needed:

- Make sure `DB_PORT`, `DB_USERNAME`, and `DB_PASSWORD` match your system setup.
- Fill in **Mailgun credentials** under the following fields:
  ```
  MAIL_MAILER=smtp
  MAIL_HOST=smtp.eu.mailgun.org
  MAIL_PORT=587
  MAIL_USERNAME=your_mailgun_username
  MAIL_PASSWORD=your_mailgun_password
  MAIL_ENCRYPTION=SSL
  MAIL_FROM_ADDRESS=your_email@example.com
  MAIL_FROM_NAME="Tech_Collab"
  ```

> 📨 **You need a [Mailgun](https://www.mailgun.com/) account** for sending emails. Once registered, you can find your credentials in your Mailgun dashboard.

#### Create the Database

- macOS: 
  ```bash
  mysql -u root -p
  CREATE DATABASE tech_collab;
  ```

- Windows:  
  Use **phpMyAdmin** (from XAMPP) → Create a new database named `tech_collab`

#### Generate Laravel Key and Migrate DB

```bash
php artisan key:generate
php artisan migrate
php artisan db:seed
php artisan serve
```

Your Laravel API will now be running on:  
**http://localhost:8000**

---

### 3️⃣ Setup the Frontend (React)

```bash
cd ../frontend
npm install
cp .env.example .env
npm run dev
```

React app should now be available at:  
**http://localhost:5173**

---

### 4️⃣ Setup the AI API (FastAPI)

```bash
pip install -r AI-features/requirements.txt
python AI-features/main.py
```

This will run the AI server at:  
**http://localhost:8001**
